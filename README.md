Hardware for Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07625.pdf

### Abstract: 
Machine learning has boomed in recent years and has introduced new challenges that have arrived from having to analyze a lot of big data. Some of these challenges are power consumption, cost, and also bandwidth. These challenges can be addressed at various levels of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms, mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies.
