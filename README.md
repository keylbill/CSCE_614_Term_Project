Hardware for Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07625.pdf

### Abstract: 
Machine learning has boomed in recent years and has introduced new challenges that have arrived from having to analyze a lot of big data. Some of these challenges are power consumption, cost, and also bandwidth. These challenges can be addressed at various levels of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms, mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies.

### Instructions: 

1. Clone the CSCE_614_Term_Project repo (https://github.com/michellbrito/CSCE_614_Term_Project.git) 
2. Open the notebook file (CSCE_614_CNN_for_MNIST.ipynb) in jupyer, or google colab
3. Run the models in different machines  
    - In google colab you're able to switch between GPU, CPU, TPU by clicking Runtime -> Change runtime type -> selecting GPU, CPU, TPU. 
    - In order to run GPU while using a non cloud machine and jupyter you will need a NVIDIA GPU (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).  
    - By default jupyter will run CPU on non cloud machines.
